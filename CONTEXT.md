## Session Log

### Session 3 — 2026-03-04

**Changes applied to `ugc-street-interview/scripts/run.py`:**

1. **Professor Curious always named clearly** — every person response says the name explicitly, out loud. Prompt instructs the name must be "unmistakably audible and visible."

2. **Two-act clip structure (3-4s + 3-4s)** — Act 1: raw emotional problem (loneliness, fear, failure). Act 2: "Professor Curious" as the turning point. Explicitly instructed in `build_person_prompt`.

3. **Emotional, raw dialogue** — All 35 person responses rewritten. Stories: mothers selling gold, fathers crying at drop-off, packing bags to quit Kota, calling home then not, crying alone at 2am.

4. **All scenes set in Kota** — New default scene `kota-coaching` added. All other scene settings updated to reference Kota, Rajasthan explicitly. Establishing/outro lines all mention Kota.

**Status:** Script updated. Kota_v1 run submitted to Azure Sora (in progress at session end).

### Session 3 (continued) — 2026-03-04: US College Interview Skill

**New skill created: `ugc-us-college-interview/`**

**Concept:** Vlogger outside elite US universities asks "What did you use to get in?"
- Majority of students say Professor Curious by name, clearly
- Minority mention Khan Academy / Quizlet first → come around to Professor Curious (creates authenticity)
- Two-act structure: Act 1 (3-4s) struggle/tools tried → Act 2 (3-4s) Professor Curious as the answer
- Aspirational FOMO play: "Harvard students use it" social proof

**Scenes built (6 total):**
- `harvard` (DEFAULT) — Johnston Gate, Cambridge MA, autumn
- `mit` — Massachusetts Ave entrance, analytical/intense
- `stanford` — White Plaza, warm California campus
- `yale` — Phelps Gate, gothic literary energy
- `princeton` — Nassau Hall gate, historic/prestigious
- `elite-campus` — Generic elite university, flexible

**Mix formula per scene (5 people):**
- p01: Pure PC advocate
- p02: "Tried Khan Academy → switched to Professor Curious"
- p03: Social proof — "my whole dorm used Professor Curious"
- p04: "Quizlet for vocab, but Professor Curious for understanding"
- p05: Matter-of-fact — "easy answer"

**To run:**
```bash
source ~/.env_azure
python3 ~/ugc-ai-ads-engine/ugc-us-college-interview/scripts/run.py \
  --product "Professor Curious" --scene harvard --run-id harvard_v1
```

**Status:** Built and committed. Ready to run.
